<p class="has-text-align-none">Volkswagen is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607157/volkswagen-cheap-ev-id-1-march-reveal-2027-production">bringing up the lights on the ID. EVERY1</a> show car that it says will become the promised €20,000 (about $20,800 USD) affordable EV that will hopefully turn around the automaker’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/30/volkswagen-hit-by-fall-in-profits-sales-in-china-slump">struggling business</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As market leaders like Tesla continue to promise — but not deliver — the elusive entry-level EV, VW is hoping to shake things up with the unveiling of plans for a whole lineup of mass-market vehicles. The car will also be a crucial competitor as VW hopes to fend off a tidal wave of affordable Chinese EVs. But whether it makes it to North America, with all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349650/trump-ev-tax-credit-tariff-congress">the uncertainty around EV policy right now</a>, remains unknown.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The car will be a crucial competitor as VW hopes to fend off a tidal wave of affordable Chinese EVs</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ID. EVERY1 will slot below <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23643047/vw-id-2-all-ev-price-photo-specs">the ID. 2all</a>, which was first unveiled in 2023 with the promised price of €25,000. Both vehicles are only slated for Europe for now, with production expected to begin in 2026 for the ID. 2all and 2027 for the ID. EVERY1. (It seems likely those names could change, too, when we actually get closer to production.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ID. EVERY1 is a small hatchback with new software and some neat tricks like a modular center console — characteristics it will share with the ID. 2all. Both models are part of the new “Electric Urban Car Family” based on front-wheel drive versions of VW’s modular electric platform. These new EVs are being developed under the umbrella of the <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/brand-group-core-17663">Core brand group</a> within the Volkswagen Group, the company said. In total, the automaker expects to unveil nine new models by 2027.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The production versions of the ID. EVERY1 and ID. 2all will be built on the second-generation version of VW’s modular “MEB” platform. The current version of MEB powers the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video">ID.4 crossover SUV</a>, the ID Buzz minivan, and a dozen other vehicles from Audi, Skoda, and others. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, for that price, you can’t expect much in the realm of performance or range. VW says the concept ID. EVERY1 tops out at 81mph and is powered by a newly developed electric motor with 94 horsepower (70kW). VW didn’t disclose the battery size, but based on the estimated 155 miles (250km) of range, we can assume it’s somewhere around 35kWh. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ID. EVERY1 won’t take up much room, at 152.8 inches in length, or around 27 inches shorter than the VW ID.4. Still, the hatchback can fit up to four passengers, with 10.8 cubic feet of storage in the trunk. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">VW says the production version of the ID. EVERY1 will be the company’s first vehicle to feature a new “powerful” software architecture that promises over-the-air updates. (Software has proven to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23508088/volkswagen-software-id4-bug-problem-smartphone">a bit of a pain for VW</a>, with bugs and infrequent updates plaguing its ID family of vehicles for years.)&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Design-wise, the ID. EVERY1 looks chunky and fairly adorable, with cues from small SUVs as well as VW’s discontinued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Up">Up</a> and <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/polo-3500">Polo</a> minicars, while also retaining stylings from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660827/volkswagen-id-life-concept-electric-car-iaa-mobility-2021">the ID. Life concept from 2021</a>. VW says the new design language that infuses the ID. EVERY1 and ID. 2all emphasizes minimalism, likability, and a “secret sauce” like the “flying roof concept,” in which the roof surface is lower in the middle without restricting headroom on the inside. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">VW is also bringing some of the modular designs from the ID Buzz to the low-cost segment. The center console can be transferred to the rear of the vehicle, and the dash features a rail on which various accessories can be affixed, including a tablet, shelf, or table. There’s also a small illuminated and removable Bluetooth speaker between the driver and front passenger, reminiscent of Rivian’s R1 vehicles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">EV prices aren’t the only place Volkswagen is trying to cut costs. Following a labor strike in Germany, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/volkswagen-to-launch-low-cost-ev-as-it-charts-a-course-for-growth-96d46c5c?st=ikFert">it reached a union deal</a> that will mean 35,000 fewer workers and billions per year in cost cutting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other automakers are increasingly piling into the affordable EV space. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1248065838/cheap-chinese-evs-us-buy-byd-electric-vehicles">As competition from China heats up</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187409/hyundai-inster-small-ev-compact-price-specs-us">Hyundai</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621276/kia-ev4-sedan-hatchback-ev2-concept-ev-day">Kia</a> are both promising more low-cost models. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277609/tesla-earnings-q3-2024-net-income-margin-sales">Tesla swears</a> it will have a lower-priced EV to reveal sometime this year. And even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24064545/ford-skunkworks-low-cost-ev-battery-tesla">Ford says it plans on releasing its own entry-level EVs</a> — just as soon as it figures out how to make them profitable.</p>

<p><em>The Last of Us</em> has caught our attention ever since the game&rsquo;s launch on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4744008/making-the-last-of-us-ps3">PlayStation 3 in 2013</a>, but the cordyceps-infested franchise has only continued to grow since then. While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"><em>The Last of Us</em> <em>Part II</em></a> came out on the PlayStation 4 in 2020, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23329531/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-ps5-remake">first game&rsquo;s remake</a> launched on PlayStation 5 in 2021. The second part of the game is also getting the PS5 treatment, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23966254/the-last-of-us-part-ii-ps5-remaster-leaks">a remastered version</a> due out on January 19th, 2024.</p>

<p>The game series was only the beginning, though. <em>The Last of Us</em> has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review">evolved into a hit TV series</a> on HBO and its streaming service Max. After a successful first season starring Bella Ramsey as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel, the show&rsquo;s producers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">working on a second season for 2025</a>, and details have already emerged <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031649/the-last-of-us-kaitlyn-dever-abby-max-casting">about its cast</a>.</p>

<title>Amazon Prime Video is getting into the wrestling business with new AEW deal</title>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All Elite Wrestling and Amazon’s Prime Video today <a href="https://www.allelitewrestling.com/post/all-elite-wrestling-and-prime-video-announce-new-pay-per-view-distribution-agreement">announced a multi-year deal</a> that will see the streaming service carry AEW’s pay-per-view events in the US, Canada, and the UK. Their partnership will start this coming weekend with <em>AEW Revolution</em>, which airs Sunday night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike <em>Thursday Night Football</em> and other sports content that comes included with a Prime subscription, you’ll still very much have to pay for each individual AEW event. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0DW69VQVN/ref=aewqrus1"><em>Revolution</em> costs $49.99</a>, if you were wondering.) This simply just gives fans another avenue for where to watch. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For AEW, the pact represents a branching out from the wrestling company’s longtime alliance with Warner Bros. Discovery. Earlier this year, WBD’s Max service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260475/aew-wbd-max-streaming-deal-announced">began simulcasting AEW’s weekly shows</a> <em>Dynamite</em> and <em>Collision</em> at the same time that they air on cable. Max is also now home to the vault of AEW’s past pay-per-view events, and WBD has said it’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/aew-tnt-tbs-new-deal-max-streaming-ppv-1236022685/">still developing the infrastructure to offer them live</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AEW has so far refrained from allowing any streamer to offer its live, marquee events as part of a base monthly subscription. That differs substantially from WWE’s strategy, where so long as you’ve got any tier of Peacock, you can watch premium live events like <em>WrestleMania</em> as they happen at no extra cost. WWE also brought its flagship weekly program, <em>Raw</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24047785/netflix-monday-night-raw-exclusive-live-streaming-leaving-cable">to Netflix in January</a> with much fanfare after the show spent decades as a staple of cable TV.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, AEW has streamed its pay-per-views through a hodgepodge of services including Bleacher Report, TrillerTV, YouTube, and now Prime Video in addition to traditional cable and satellite providers. Having them all on Max after the fact is convenient, but if you want to catch AEW’s biggest shows live, you’ve still got to pay for each one — at least for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netflix is diving deeper into live content with a new late-night talk show hosted by comedian John Mulaney. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/john-mulaney-live-variety-talk-show">Starting March 12th</a>, Netflix will air <em>Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney</em> every Wednesday at 10PM ET.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The late-night show, which Netflix will stream live for 12 weeks, will feature chats with celebrity guests. It marks the second live series that Netflix now streams regularly, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605641/wwe-raw-netflix-streaming-glitches">in addition to WWE’s <em>Monday Night Raw</em></a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Up until this year, Netflix had only used live streams for one-time events, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/16/23685828/netflix-love-is-blind-reunion-live-delay-problems">the <em>Love is Blind</em> reunion</a>, the fight <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/16/24298026/mike-tyson-jake-paul-netflix-livestream-quality-issues-buffering-dropped-stream">with Jake Paul and Mike Tyson</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/26/24329685/netflix-nfl-christmas-day-games-streaming-numbers">live NFL games</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194873/netflix-joe-rogan-live-comedy-special-august">various comedy specials</a>. Not all of these events went smoothly, and Netflix has been under pressure to make sure its streams are buffer-free now that it’s airing the WWE’s flagship show.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netflix is bound to expand on its library of live content in the future. The company previously expressed interest in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243999/netflix-live-episodes-hot-ones">airing live episodes of <em>Hot Ones</em></a>, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319564/buzzfeed-hot-ones-first-we-feast-sale">BuzzFeed has since sold the show</a>.</p>

<title>Google is adding more AI Overviews and a new ‘AI Mode’ to Search</title>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview">AI-ification of Google Search</a> continues to accelerate: the company announced on Wednesday that it will start showing AI Overviews for even more kinds of queries, and that users around the world, even those who are logged out of Google, will start seeing them too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an even more ambitious AI search tool coming to Google, too. It’s called AI Mode, and it brings a search-centric chatbot right to the core Google experience. It is, more or less, Google’s take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24187792/perplexity-ai-news-updates">Perplexity</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283906/openai-chatgpt-live-web-search-searchgpt">ChatGPT Search</a>. For now, AI Mode is just a test — it’s only available to users paying for Google One AI Premium, and even they will have to enable it in the Labs section of Search. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea behind AI Mode is that a lot of people searching Google would actually prefer to have their results be primarily AI-generated. If you switch to AI Mode (it’s a tab in the search page or the Google app, like Images or News) and enter a query, you’ll get back a generated answer, based on everything in Google’s search index, with a few supporting links interspersed throughout. The user experience feels a little like Gemini or any other chatbot, but you’re interacting with a Search-specific model, which means it’s more able to tap real-time data and interact directly with the web.</p>
<img alt="A screenshot of an iPhone showing Google search results." src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/AI-Mode-Boston-example-1-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" title="A screenshot of an iPhone showing Google search results." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">AI Mode is just the latest signal of just how important AI-generated content has become to Google Search, and how confident the company is becoming in what its models can deliver despite its well-documented issues with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164119/google-ai-overview-mistakes-search-race-openai">rock eating and glue pizza</a>. “What we’re finding from people who are using AI Overviews is that they’re really bringing different kinds of questions to Google,” says Robby Stein, a VP of product on the Search team. “They’re more complex questions, that may have been a little bit harder before.” Google is bringing the Gemini 2.0 model to AI Overviews, and Stein says that will make Google more useful for questions about math, coding, and anything that requires more sophisticated reasoning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Google moves ever deeper into AI search, it seems to be running away from linking to websites — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders">the fundamental value trade</a> it made with the internet. Stein is adamant that’s not the case. “We see that with AI Overviews, people will get the context, and they’ll click in. And when they click in and go to websites, they’ll stay longer on those websites. They’re probably better customers of those websites because they already have context coming in.” He says he hopes AI Overviews and AI Mode bring new people to Google for new things, rather than cannibalizing their existing behavior. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stein says that AI Mode isn’t a Trojan horse for a complete search overhaul, because people use Google for too many things to replace it all with a chatbot. But there’s no denying that Google’s AI efforts are starting to completely surround, and quickly change, everything about what happens when you Google.</p>

<title>Delta Air Lines bets on ‘blended-wing’ flight to reduce emissions</title>

<img alt="Rendering of JetZero blended-wing plane" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/JetZero-Exterior.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" />
	<figcaption>JetZero aims to launch a demonstrator proof of concept by 2027. | Image: JetZero</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Delta Air Lines is backing a startup that wants to design more fuel-efficient, blended-wing-body aircraft in the hopes of reducing its carbon footprint and making air travel more sustainable. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The airline said today that it will help support the development of startup <a href="https://www.jetzero.aero/">JetZero’s blended-wing-body</a> (BWB) demonstrator aircraft that aims to cut fuel consumption, emissions, and noise. Delta isn’t providing any capital investment in the company but, rather, operational support to help make its dream of a blended-wing aircraft a reality. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">JetZero will join Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab incubator, where it will receive “operational expertise” from the airline’s engineers in the design and construction of a BWB demonstrator aircraft, with the aim to test it in 2027. In 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137782/delta-carbon-neutral-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-airlines">Delta pledged to spend $1 billion on sustainability efforts</a>, including the Sustainable Skies Lab, with the aim of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. </p>
<img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/JetZero-Cabin.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" title="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a BWB aircraft, there’s no clear dividing line between the wings and the main body of the craft, as they are smoothly blended together. The main advantage of blended-wing designs is to reduce drag associated with conventional tube-and-wing airframes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But more than that, JetZero says BWB designs can help reduce emissions by up to 50 percent, while keeping the same engine technology and fueling infrastructure. By reducing drag, providing more lifting surface area and even load and lift distribution, and reducing the overall weight, the company said it can slash the emissions from a conventional airframe in half.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Long Beach Airport-based startup was founded in 2021 with the goal of developing next-gen sustainable aircraft on the way to zero-emission aviation. The startup says its BWB aircraft can carry up to 250 passengers, the equivalent of a midrange international aircraft. And with engines mounted on top of the aircraft, the noise profile is expected to be much quieter. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>In a BWB aircraft, there’s no clear dividing line between the wings and the main body of the craft</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Delta’s support for JetZero comes on top of a <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/jetzero-receives-235m-defense-department-award-to-develop-blended-wing-aircraft/">$235 million grant from the US Air Force</a> that was awarded in 2023 for the development of a full-scale demonstrator aircraft to validate the blended-wing concept. The company is also collaborating with Northrop Grumman and Scaled Composites to build and test the aircraft.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Delta also believes that JetZero’s BWB design will be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel, which the airline hopes will comprise at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23632150/delta-airlines-sustainable-aviation-fuel-climate-change">95 percent of its fuel consumption by 2050</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some challenges to designing a blended-wing aircraft, such as developing a safe evacuation process in the case of an emergency landing. Also, the seating would be theater-style, as opposed to rows in a tube-shaped airframe, which could present limitations to the number of exit doors. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://aviationweek.com/defense/aircraft-propulsion/boeing-unveils-new-military-blended-wing-body-concept">Boeing</a>, <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/stories/2020-11-imagine-travelling-in-this-blended-wing-body-aircraft">Airbus</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics/x-48b/">NASA</a> have all worked on BWB designs, but none of their concepts have ever made it into production. FAA certification is also unknown, and until someone actually tries, we may not know what kind of safety challenges will arise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Delta believes that JetZero’s design presents a solution “within reach.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Working with JetZero to realize an entirely new airframe and experience for customers and employees is bold and important work to advance the airline industry’s fuel saving initiatives and innovation goals,” said Amelia DeLuca, Delta’s chief sustainability officer, in a statement.</p>

<title>Nintendo wins piracy lawsuit against file-sharing site</title>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo has won its legal battle against Dstorage, the French company it accused of hosting pirated games on its file-sharing site 1fichier.com. In a press release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">sent to outlets like <em>Eurogamer</em></a> and <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/french-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-nintendo-in-lawsuit-against-1fichier-for-hosting-pirated-content.667952/"><em>GBATemp</em></a>, Nintendo says a French Court agreed that 1fichier.com is “liable for failing to remove or block access to unauthorised copies of Nintendo games stored on this platform.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, a Paris court ordered Dstorage to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-awarded-1-13m-after-file-hosting-site-failed-to-remove-pirated-games-210608/">pay Nintendo $1.13 million</a> for failing to remove pirated games despite warnings from Nintendo. Though Dstorage appealed this decision, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">the court ultimately sided with Nintendo</a>. The company later brought the case before the highest French judiciary court, which has now ruled against Dstorage as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nintendo is pleased with the Court&#8217;s finding of liability against DSTORAGE and believes that it is significant not only for Nintendo, but for the entire games industry,” Nintendo said in its press release. It adds that the decision “will prevent sharehosters like 1fichier.com” from claiming they need a court order to follow through on requests to remove copyrighted content.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo has only stepped up its legal fights over the past year. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">company sued Yuzu</a>, the developers behind a Nintendo Switch emulator, resulting in it shutting down completely, and also went after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">the Switch emulator Ryujinx</a>. It also sued the developers of <em>Palworld</em> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">allegedly infringing on its patents</a>.</p>

<title>YouTube brings its more affordable ‘Premium Lite’ subscription to the US</title>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is expanding its pilot of a new Premium Lite subscription plan to the United States, the company <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/">announced today</a>. Priced at $7.99 per month compared to the $13.99 charge for regular YouTube Premium, the cheaper tier offers “most” videos without ads — including “gaming, fashion, beauty, news, and more.” The major exception is music. For ad-free music videos, you’ll still need to step up to the standard Premium plan, which also gives you offline downloads and background playback. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Premium Lite doesn’t include those perks: it’s really just about removing ads from your YouTube experience. And as someone who let his YouTube Premium subscription lapse a few months ago, let me tell you: there are a <em>ton</em> of ad breaks these days.</p>
<img alt="A screenshot comparing the features of YouTube’s Premium and Premium Lite plans." src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/lite.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211" title="A screenshot comparing the features of YouTube’s Premium and Premium Lite plans." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“In the coming weeks, we&#8217;ll also make Premium Lite available to all users in our current pilot countries — Thailand, Germany, and Australia,” the company added in its blog post, noting that YouTube Music and Premium reach over 125 million subscribers globally (when you include trial users). Premium Lite will expand to additional countries later this year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube has been testing the plan off and on in select markets for several years now, with the earliest reports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605455/youtube-premium-lite-pilot-benelux-nordics-experiment-ad-free-subscription">dating back to 2021</a>. In more recent tests, the company clarified that subscribers may still see “non-interruptive ads when you search and browse” in addition to the video ads attached to music and shorts. It continues to boggle my mind that there’s still no YouTube TV and YouTube Premium bundle. Surely that can’t be far off.</p>

<title>Why I love the Logitech MX Vertical wireless mouse</title>

</figure>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Victoria Song is a senior reviewer at </em>The Verge<em> who mostly focuses on health tech and wearables and who, she says, occasionally has “existential crises over silly gadgets I bought on TikTok against my better judgment.” One of her favorite gadgets is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT">Logitech MX Vertical wireless mouse</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When did you get the Logitech MX Vertical?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I got this mouse in March 2022, so just about three years ago now. But I’ve been a vertical mouse enthusiast since I reviewed the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/evoluent-verticalmouse-c-right-wired">Evoluent VerticalMouse C</a> for <em>PCMag </em>in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why did you get it?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’d been using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical/dp/B00BIFNTMC">Anker’s wireless vertical mouse</a> for about three and a half years. It finally crapped out on me after my cat batted it from my desk. RIP. I didn’t love that it required a USB dongle for connectivity, and I had only heard good things about Logitech’s version from other vertical mouse fans, so I opted to shell out a bit more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you like about it?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can use it wired or wirelessly, and the battery lasts months on a single charge. Switching cursor speed is easy, and it’s got two customizable buttons right over the thumb. I mostly use it for forward and back, but it’s super convenient. I used to get wrist pain from using regular mice, and now I have zero wrist pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there anything about it that you wish were different or that would improve it?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is kinda gross, but it’s a dead skin magnet. Every once in a while, you have to take a cleaning wipe and really scrub that textured grippy area down, or you’ll have crusty, dusty imprints of your hand, bordered by dead skin. And I do mean a cleaning wipe. At first, I was wiping this thing down with a teeny bit of soap and a damp paper towel — nope. That same area also gets worn down by finger oil, so even if you regularly clean it, it can end up looking a bit greasy after a few weeks. The bottom is also a dust and cat hair magnet. Basically, I clean this mouse more than I should have to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Otherwise, I wish it came in more colors like the cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Ergonomic-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B09J1TB35S/ref=sr_1_3">Logitech Lift</a>, which comes in white and pink. I was tempted to switch, but unfortunately, I have piano fingers and the Lift’s smaller size doesn’t work for me. Even on the MX Vertical, my index and middle fingers extend beyond the mouse’s edge.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“My wrist pain disappeared almost overnight”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who would you recommend it to?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anyone who has hobbies that depend on a healthy, pain-free wrist. Before switching to vertical mice, I had a lot of wrist and hand cramping from using trackpads, regular mice, and all my handwriting. I’ve been working on all of that, but it was so much harder for me to adjust my natural pen grip than it was to adopt a vertical mouse. And I’m not kidding when I said my wrist pain disappeared almost overnight — and comes back whenever I have to use my laptop’s trackpad on a work trip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been using vertical mice for close to a decade now, but I distinctly remember that it took a few days before I felt really comfortable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, the MX Vertical doesn’t have a left-handed version. So if you’re a southpaw, you might want to look for a vertical mouse model that has both versions. (It’s baffling, but the Logitech Lift has both left- and right-handed versions, even if the MX Vertical doesn’t…)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What else are you doing these days?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These days, I’ve been exploring gadgets that <em>aren’t</em> smartwatches — smart glasses, smart rings, AI wearables, CGMs, and even an NFC nail chip. I’m also trying to get back into another training block after I got derailed by a cold and some bad weather. (Training blocks are periods of structured workouts where you focus on a specific goal. My next one is going to be a 12-week block where I try to improve my 5K running speed.) Lately, I’ve also been trying to get back into my non-work hobbies, like calligraphy and scrapbooking.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Apple launches new Mac Studios with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips</title>

	<figcaption>The new Mac Studio.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After over a year and a half, Apple is updating the Mac Studio with a curious new quirk: it straddles two generations, with an M4 Max for the base model and an M3 Ultra for the upgraded model. You can <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1631013/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-studio">preorder both versions at Apple’s site</a> for $1,999 (M4 Max) and $3,999 (M3 Ultra), and they’ll be available to buy on March 12th.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1631013/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F03%2Fapple-unveils-new-mac-studio-the-most-powerful-mac-ever%2F">says the M4 Max Mac Studio</a> is “up to 3.5x faster” than the original M1 Max version, with a 14- to 16-core CPU and 32- to 40-core GPU. Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">M4 Max MacBook Pro</a>, this version of the Studio starts with 36GB of RAM (up from 32GB in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23745477/apple-mac-studio-m2-max-ultra-chip-update-features-specs-wwdc-2023">M2 model</a>) and can be had with as much as 128GB, a bump from the 96GB ceiling of the M2 Max Studio. Like its outgoing predecessor, it starts with 512GB of SSD storage but can go as high as 8TB.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Apple-Mac-Studio-2025-back.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" title="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the Mac Studio with an M3 Ultra chip sounds like it’s going to scream. It gets up to 32 cores, 24 of which are performance cores — something <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1631013/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F03%2Fapple-reveals-m3-ultra-taking-apple-silicon-to-a-new-extreme%2F">Apple notes is “50 percent more than any previous Ultra chip.”</a> The GPU has a base 60-core configuration that maxes out at 80 cores, and Apple says it has a 32-core Neural Engine for machine learning and AI applications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The M3 Ultra version of the Studio has 96GB of RAM to start, but it can go up to a gobsmacking 512GB of RAM — enough to run some very hefty AI models locally. Finally, you can bump the base 1TB internal storage to as high as 16 terabytes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple says the Mac Studios’ GPUs will feature dynamic caching — that is, it will store frequently accessed data in cache to drop latency — and hardware-accelerated mesh shading, both firsts for the company’s graphics chips. It will also have “a second-generation ray-tracing engine for more seamless content creation and gaming.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the outside, the new Mac Studio is the same squat, square-ish silver box as before, with two USB-C ports and an SD Card slot on the front. Around the back, you’ll find four more USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and one port each for ethernet, power, and audio, as well as an audio jack and the power button. Both CPU configurations come with Thunderbolt 5 connections, but as with older-generation Studios, only the four rear USB-C ports are Thunderbolt 5 on the M4 Max — you’ll need an M3 Ultra Mac Studio to get it on all six.</p>
